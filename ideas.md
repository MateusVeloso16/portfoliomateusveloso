## Idea 1: The "Glass & Steel" Industrial Minimalist
**Design Movement:** Industrial Modernism meets Apple's "Pro" aesthetic.
**Core Principles:**
1.  **Precision Engineering:** Reflecting the mechanical engineering background with pixel-perfect alignment and technical detailing.
2.  **Materiality:** Heavy use of "glassmorphism" (frosted glass), brushed metal textures, and deep, rich backgrounds.
3.  **Data Visualization:** Skills and experience presented as technical specs or HUD (Heads-Up Display) elements.
4.  **Contrast:** High contrast between the dark "Titanium" background and neon/bright accent colors (referencing code syntax highlighting).

**Color Philosophy:**
Dark, premium, and technical.
-   **Background:** Deep Titanium Grey (#1c1c1e) and Midnight Blue (#000e1a).
-   **Text:** San Francisco White and Cool Grey.
-   **Accents:** "Electric Blue" and "Safety Orange" (nod to engineering/industrial safety + code).

**Layout Paradigm:**
-   **Bento Box Grid:** Content organized in highly structured, rounded-corner modules (like Apple's summary slides or widgets).
-   **Asymmetric Balance:** Large hero module balanced by smaller technical spec modules.

**Signature Elements:**
-   **Frosted Glass Cards:** Content sits on blurred, semi-transparent backgrounds.
-   **Technical Schematics:** Subtle background patterns resembling CAD drawings or circuit traces.
-   **"Spec Sheet" Typography:** Monospace fonts for data points, sans-serif for narrative.

**Interaction Philosophy:**
-   **Haptic-Visual Feedback:** Buttons feel "clicky" with instant visual recoil.
-   **Parallax Depth:** Layers move at different speeds to create a sense of physical depth inside the screen.

**Animation:**
-   **Mechanical Unfolding:** Elements expand and slide out like precision machinery.
-   **Smooth Damping:** All movements have heavy, smooth friction (Apple's spring physics).

**Typography System:**
-   **Headings:** SF Pro Display (Bold, Tight tracking).
-   **Body:** SF Pro Text.
-   **Data/Code:** JetBrains Mono or SF Mono.

## Idea 2: The "Ethereal Intelligence" (AI/ML Focus)
**Design Movement:** Organic Futurism / Apple "Intelligence" Glow.
**Core Principles:**
1.  **Fluid Intelligence:** Representing AI/ML through fluid, morphing shapes and gradients.
2.  **Human-Centric Tech:** Warm, approachable tones mixed with futuristic clarity.
3.  **Focus & Clarity:** Extreme minimalism where content "breathes" in vast whitespace.
4.  **Emergence:** Content fades in and emerges softly, like an idea forming.

**Color Philosophy:**
Light, airy, and iridescent.
-   **Background:** Off-white / Soft Silver (#f5f5f7).
-   **Text:** Dark Slate (#1d1d1f).
-   **Accents:** Iridescent gradients (Aurora Borealis style - Purple, Blue, Cyan) representing AI.

**Layout Paradigm:**
-   **Central Axis:** Content flows down a central narrative line, expanding outward.
-   **Floating Elements:** Images and cards float with soft, large drop shadows, detaching from the background.

**Signature Elements:**
-   **The "Glow":** A subtle, moving gradient orb that follows the cursor or highlights active sections (Siri/Apple Intelligence vibe).
-   **Soft-Edge Imagery:** Images fade into the background rather than having hard borders.
-   **Interactive Particles:** Subtle background particles that connect (nodes) representing neural networks.

**Interaction Philosophy:**
-   **Magnetic Cursor:** Elements gently pull towards the cursor.
-   **Soft Focus:** Hovering over an element brings it into sharp focus while blurring the surroundings.

**Animation:**
-   **Morphing:** Shapes change smoothly into one another.
-   **Blur-in:** Text and images enter with a blur-to-sharp transition.

**Typography System:**
-   **Headings:** SF Pro Display (Light/Thin weights, large scale).
-   **Body:** SF Pro Text (High readability).

## Idea 3: The "Product Launch" Cinematic Experience
**Design Movement:** Cinematic Storytelling / Apple Keynote Style.
**Core Principles:**
1.  **The Hero's Journey:** The portfolio is treated as a product launch event. Mateus is the "Product".
2.  **Cinematic Scaling:** Huge, screen-filling typography and imagery.
3.  **Rhythm & Pace:** Controlled scrolling where the user is guided frame-by-frame.
4.  **Show, Don't Tell:** Visuals dominate; text is concise and punchy.

**Color Philosophy:**
Dramatic and bold.
-   **Background:** Pure Black (#000000).
-   **Text:** White and Silver gradients.
-   **Accents:** A single, bold "Launch Color" (e.g., a deep Crimson or Royal Purple).

**Layout Paradigm:**
-   **Full-Screen Sections:** Each section (About, Skills, Projects) takes up the full viewport (Snap scrolling).
-   **Split Screen:** One side visual, one side narrative, alternating as you scroll.

**Signature Elements:**
-   **Big Type:** Massive headlines that act as graphical elements.
-   **Spotlight Effects:** Lighting effects that reveal content as if a spotlight is hitting it.
-   **Device Frames:** Projects displayed inside high-fidelity Apple device mockups.

**Interaction Philosophy:**
-   **Scroll-Jacking (Tasteful):** The scroll controls the timeline of the animation/presentation.
-   **Progressive Disclosure:** Information is revealed only when needed.

**Animation:**
-   **Zoom & Scale:** Elements zoom in from the background or scale down to fit.
-   **Text Reveals:** Characters or words slide up from a mask.

**Typography System:**
-   **Headings:** SF Pro Display (Heavy/Black weights).
-   **Body:** SF Pro Text (Medium weight for contrast).
